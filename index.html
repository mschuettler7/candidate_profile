			Republican Congressional candidate Tina Forte is challenging Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC) for the second time in New York’s 14th district. Forte’s platform includes promises to rid congress of “socialism” which she believes is destroying the American dream, according to her<a href = "https://tinaforteforcongress.com/" >  campaign website </a>. In 2022, Forte <a href= "https://nypost.com/2023/06/13/aoc-in-rematch-with-george-santos-linked-republican-tina-forte/"> clinched 27 per cent </a> of the vote against Ocasio-Cortez, who has not debated Forte since campaigning began this year. Given Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity in her district, <a href= "https://nypost.com/2023/06/13/aoc-in-rematch-with-george-santos-linked-republican-tina-forte/"> some see Forte’s campaign as a longshot </a>. 

		</p>

		<section class="content-block">
			<h2>Supports the Police and Denounces Bail Reform </h2>
			<p>
				Forte has primarily positioned herself as a law-and-order candidate, eager to “back the blue”, as stated on her website. She argues that AOC and other Democrats pushed bail reform policies that increased crime in New York. If elected, Forte promises to support policies which “remove bad cops and reward good cops”. 

			</p>

			<p>
				Though Forte is running on a law-and-order platform, she is connected to more than one person with a criminal record. 
			</p>

			<h2>Jan. 6 Rioter, George Santos Supporter, and Familial Criminal Ties</h2>
			<p>
				In her first run for office in 2022, Forte hired the now-ostracised former congressmen George Santos’ campaign consulting firm, Red Strategies USA. City & State has <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2023/06/jan-6-rioter-and-george-santos-ally-tina-forte-says-shell-challenge-aoc-again/387440/">since reported </a>she was the only politician to do so. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Forte herself reported participating in the events on Jan. 6 in Washington DC, protesting President Biden’s inauguration. Though this information has recently been scrubbed from her website, Snopes (a fact-checking website) <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/08/25/tina-forte-capitol-riot/"> published images </a> of her allegedly at the Capitol Riot in 2021. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/36-months-jan-6-attack-capitol-0"> 749 members </a> of the rioting group have been sentenced since 2021, according to the US Attorney’s office. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In 2019, Forte’s family was involved in a drug bust, resulting in the arrest of her husband and son. In a <a href ="https://www.thedailybeast.com/aoc-rival-tina-fortes-family-was-caught-in-2019-drug-and-gun-bust">statement to the Daily Beast </a>, Forte explained that her son their warehouse for a “nonviolent marijuana offense and possessed a firearm”. Coincidentally, Forte also supports expunging the records of non-violent charges (like marijuana possession), in states where it is now legal.

			<h2>Streamline Legal Immigration While Backing Anti-Immigration Policies.</h2>
			<p>
				As immigration has increased across New York City in the past few years, Forte believes the city’s resources are strained. If elected, Forte would push for the completion of the southern border wall, started by former president Donald Trump, and other policies aimed at deporting illegal immigrants. Forte also hopes to streamline the legal immigration process, though she has not indicated how.

			<h2>Fire AOC</h2>
			<p>
				Forte’s most prominent campaign strategy has been to attack Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. With posters, stickers, and rally slogans, Forte has attempted to label Ocasio Cortez as a “socialist”. Yard ads handed out by her supports read “AOC loves Hezbollah” and “Make AOC Bartend Again”.

<!-- I created a class for the last section so I can add some padding at the bottom -->
			<p class= "lastsection">
			Though her platform includes some references to policies, her attempt to “fire” Ocasio-Cortez remains Forte’s most prolific message.
